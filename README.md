# WalkRideGM community-assets
Community Assets for WalkRideGM and associated hyperlocal groups 

Find enclosed the logos that we intend to use, with as little compression as possible. It might be a requirerment to resize or compress them to share them, but a lot of services will do this automagically already for you.

## Why Github?

Github gives us version control of all the images and assets, giving us the full journey of our assets over timee. This is intending to be used for periodic snapshotting of things that are already within Google Drive.

## Contriibuting

Contributing is as easy as making an account here on Github, making a 'clone' and opening a pull request after you have added your file.
